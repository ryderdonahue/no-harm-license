In order to assure technology we develop will be used only to further the peaceful and productive advancement of all of humankind, a software license enforcing these values must be written and adopted.

Other licenses and codes of ethics have been crafted in the past that attempt to achieve a subset of these goals (see GNU, and ACM Code of ethics), however predecessors to this license and code of ethics intentionally leave room for subjective interpretation that can lead to harmful implementations of technology covered under those terms.

The goal of this license is to create a clear and objective definition that ensures there is no possible interpretation of the terms that could lead to harm without violating the terms of the license.

While some may argue the merit of, for example, allowing weapons research and development for defensive and offensive purposes to 'eliminate or mitigate groups or individuals that seek to harm the public good', such arguments are quickly diminished by asking if said opposing parties believe they are 'harming the public good'. These opposing perceptions and values are precisely the reason an 'all inclusive' NO HARM license must be implemented.
